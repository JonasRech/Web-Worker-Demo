    <h2>Web Worker Demo</h2>

    <p>This demo walks through a Real World UI problem and shows how a using a Web Worker or Worker might solve it.</p>

    <p>But first - What is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Worker?</a></p>
    <p>Basically, Web Workers give you access to another thread(s) which you can use to run some of your code "in the background". If you've ever had an infinate loop block you from click on different elements on your web page, then you've run into something that's "Blocking" the stack. Beacause we only have 1 thread to run our code on, and we can only run things in order if one of our functions or loops doesn't stop, then it's blocking any other functions or loops from running.</p>

    <p>But sometimes we just naturally have functions that take a long time to execute. Mabye we have to filter through a million records in order to give the user back what they requested. Traditionally the user would have to wait until the sorting was finished in order to even click on anything on the page, but with Web Workers, we can just pass that functionality over to them which allows our main thread to stay clear so the user can continue to use the site.</p>

    <p>This demo will simulate the above situation by having a while loop that is counting down from 1 billion, 1 number at a time,. As you can imagine that might take some time, even for a computer. You will see how this function blocks the user from clicking a button until the loop is over. Then, you will see the same code run using a Worker and how it fixes the "blocking" issue. </p>
